            " Unit-2 Deep Learning Architectures NRI INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY 1 Unit-2 Deep Learnig Architectures Machine Learning and Deep Learning: Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to learn and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. It involves training algorithms on large datasets to identify patterns and relationships and then using these patterns to make predictions or decisions about new data. What are the Different Types of Machine Learning? Machine learning is further divided into categories based on the data on which we are training our model. • Supervised Learning – This method is used when we have Training data along with the labels for the correct answer. • Unsupervised Learning – In this task our main objective is to find the patterns or groups in the dataset at hand because we don’t have any particular labels in this dataset. Deep Learning Deep learning, on the other hand, is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers to analyze complex patterns and relationships in data. It is inspired by the structure and function of the human brain and has been successful in a variety of tasks, such as computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition. Deep learning models are trained using large amounts of data and algorithms that are able to learn and improve over time, becoming more accurate as they process more data. This makes them well-suited to complex, real-world problems and enables them to learn and adapt to new situations. Future of Machine Learning and Deep Learning Both machine learning and deep learning have the potential to transform a wide range of industries, including healthcare, finance, retail, and transportation, by providing insights and automating decision-making processes. • Machine Learning:\n",
            "Machine learning is a subset, an application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that offers the ability of the system to learn and improve from experience without being programmed to that level. Machine Learning uses data to train and find accurate results. Machine learning focuses on the development of a computer program that accesses the data and uses it to learn from itself. • Deep Learning: Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning where the artificial neural network and the recurrent neural network come in relation. The algorithms are created exactly just like machine learning but it consists of many more levels of algorithms. All these networks of the algorithm are together called the artificial neural network. In much simpler terms, it replicates just like the human brain as all the neural networks are connected in the brain, which exactly is the concept of deep learning. It solves all the complex problems with the help of algorithms and its process. Unit-2 Deep Learning Architectures NRI INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY 2 Difference Between Machine Learning and Deep Learning S. No. Machine Learning Deep Learning 1. Machine Learning is a superset of Deep Learning Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning 2. The data represented in Machine Learning is quite different compared to Deep Learning as it uses structured data The data representation used in Deep Learning is quite different as it uses neural networks(ANN). 3. Machine Learning is an evolution of AI. Deep Learning is an evolution of Machine Learning. Basically, it is how deep is the machine learning. 4. Machine learning consists of thousands of data points. Big Data: Millions of data points. 5. Outputs: Numerical Value, like classification of the score. Anything from numerical values to free-form elements, such as free text and sound. 6. Uses various types of automated\n",
            "algorithms that turn to model functions and predict future action from data. Uses a neural network that passes data through processing layers to, interpret data features and relations. 7. Algorithms are detected by data analysts to examine specific variables in data sets. Algorithms are largely self-depicted on data analysis once they’re put into production. 8. Machine Learning is highly used to stay in the competition and learn new things. Deep Learning solves complex machine- learning issues. 9. Training can be performed using the CPU (Central Processing Unit). A dedicated GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) is required for training. 10. More human intervention is involved in getting results. Although more difficult to set up, deep learning requires less intervention once it is running. Representation Learning: Representation learning is a very important aspect of machine learning which automatically discovers the feature patterns in the data. When the machine is provided with the data, it learns the representation itself without any human intervention. The goal of representation learning is to train machine learning algorithms to learn useful representations, such as those that are Unit-2 Deep Learning Architectures NRI INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY 3 interpretable, incorporate latent features, or can be used for transfer learning. In this article, we will discuss the concept of representation learning along with its need and different approaches. 1. Methods of Representation Learning 1. Supervised Methods 2. Unsupervised Methods 2. Representation learning is a class of machine learning approaches that allow a system to discover the representations required for feature detection or classification from raw data. The requirement for manual feature engineering is reduced by allowing a machine to learn the features and apply them to a given activity. 3. In representation learning, data is sent into the machine, and it learns the representation on its own. It is a way\n"
